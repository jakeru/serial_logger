#+title: Serial Server and Client

* Introduction
These tools can be used to share a serial port that is connected to a device
that logs data and accepts commands through this port.

* Dependencies
Both tools are written in Python and has been tested with Python 3.10. They also
require the =pyserial= package which is available at [[https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/][pypi.org/project/serial]].

* Serial client
This tool is used to write commands to a device connected to a serial port. This
can be more convenient than to connect to the device directly because you can
use the history feature of your shell or the tool itself.

* Serial server
The serial server tool is used to continuously read from a serial port. By doing
so it is easy to save this log for later analysis.
This tool also opens a server TCP socket and waits for clients to connect.
By installing this tool as a systemd service you can have this tool running
always in the background.
